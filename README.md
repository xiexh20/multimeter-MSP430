# multimeter-MSP430
The source code of a MSP430-based digital multimeter in Electronic design contest. 

## Introduction
The competition task is on file 2018年北京交通大学大学生电子设计竞赛赛题.pdf. We were asked to use MSP430G2553, extension board and necessary signal processing circuit to make a digital multimeter to measure AC amplitude, frequency, DC offset and duty. 

## Our result
During the one-day competion, our team had implemented measurement of AC amplitude(full range as required), DC offset(part of the required range), frequency(the extended range). Our score ranked the third of all 50 teams(3/50) and thus won the first prize.
